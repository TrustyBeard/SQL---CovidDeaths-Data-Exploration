# SQL---CovidDeaths-Data-Exploration

This project is a brief exploration of Covid-19 deaths and related interests in SQL using data from 2020 and 2021. The data is in the CSV files included within the repositories and were imported into SSMS as flat file type.

The intended use of this is to visualize some of the data in Tableau and further expand upon it in the future.
