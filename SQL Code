SELECT *

SELECT * 
FROM PortfolioProjectWalkthrough..CovidVaccinations


SELECT Location, date, total_cases, new_cases, total_deaths, population
FROM PortfolioProjectWalkthrough..CovidDeaths
ORDER BY 1


SELECT Location, date, total_cases, total_deaths, total_deaths / NULLIF(total_cases, 0) AS MortRate

ORDER BY 5

--SSMS Complained that 'Operand data type varchar is invalid for divide operator'.

SELECT * from INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS WHERE TABLE_NAME='CovidDeaths'

-- All data types in table CovidDeaths that was imported to this project were varchar.
-- A conversion to a different data type is needed to apply a divide operator
-- and since the import as varchar data type was erroneous altering the table is warranted

ALTER TABLE CovidDeaths
ALTER COLUMN total_cases float;
ALTER TABLE CovidDeaths
ALTER COLUMN total_deaths float;
